ðŸš€Monitoring & Logging in Kubernetes

Adding another skill to my DevOps journey-Monitoring!

I have successfully set up monitoring and logging for a Kubernetes cluster using Prometheus and Grafana, diving deeper into observability. Here's the process I followed:

Set up monitoring, logging, and gain insights from the cluster by following these steps with Helm charts:

+ Installed and configured Prometheus.

Ran kubectl commands to gather Kubernetes resources. Used port forwarding to access Prometheus and Grafana.

âœ” Executed Prometheus queries to monitor container and CPU usage.

Logged into Grafana and added Prometheus as the data source.

Created a Grafana dashboard to visualize real-time insights from the Kubernetes cluster.
